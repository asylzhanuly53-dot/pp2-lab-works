# You can display a string literal with the print() function:

# Example
print("Hello")
print('Hello')

# You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:

# Example
print("It's alright")
print("He is called 'Johnny'")
print('He is called "Johnny"')

# Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:

# Example
a = "Hello"
print(a)

# You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:

# Example
# You can use three double quotes:

a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
print(a)

# Or three single quotes:

# Example
a = '''Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.'''
print(a)

# Get the character at position 1 (remember that the first character has the position 0):

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a[1])

# Since strings are arrays, we can loop through the characters in a string, with a for loop.

# Example
# Loop through the letters in the word "banana":

for x in "banana":
  print(x)


#   To get the length of a string, use the len() function.

# Example
# The len() function returns the length of a string:

a = "Hello, World!"
print(len(a))

# To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword in.

# Example
# Check if "free" is present in the following text:

txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("free" in txt)

# Print only if "free" is present:

txt = "The best things in life are free!"
if "free" in txt:
  print("Yes, 'free' is present.")

#   To check if a certain phrase or character is NOT present in a string, we can use the keyword not in.

# Example
# Check if "expensive" is NOT present in the following text:

txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("expensive" not in txt)

# print only if "expensive" is NOT present:

txt = "The best things in life are free!"
if "expensive" not in txt:
  print("No, 'expensive' is NOT present.")
