# The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

# The elif keyword allows you to check multiple expressions for True and execute a block of code as soon as one of the conditions evaluates to True.

# Example
a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")

#   You can have as many elif statements as you need. Python will check each condition in order and execute the first one that is true.

# Example
# Testing multiple conditions:

score = 75

if score >= 90:
  print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
  print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
  print("Grade: C")
elif score >= 60:
  print("Grade: D")


#   When you use elif, Python evaluates the conditions from top to bottom.
#   As soon as it finds a condition that is true, it executes that block and skips 
#   all remaining conditions.
