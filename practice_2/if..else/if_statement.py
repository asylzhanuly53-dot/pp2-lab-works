# If statement:

a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")

#   How If Statements Work
# The if statement evaluates a condition (an expression that results in True or False). If the condition is true, the code block inside the if statement is executed. If the condition is false, the code block is skipped.

# Example
# Checking if a number is positive:

number = 15
if number > 0:
  print("The number is positive")

#   Indentation
# Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

# Example
# If statement, without indentation (will raise an error):

a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
print("b is greater than a") # you will get an error
