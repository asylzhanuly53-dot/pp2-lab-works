# To create a class, use the keyword class:

# ExampleGet your own Python Server
# Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x:

class MyClass:
  x = 5

#   Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects:

# Example
# Create an object named p1, and print the value of x:

p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)

# You can delete objects by using the del keyword:

# Example
# Delete the p1 object:

del p1

# You can create multiple objects from the same class:

# Example
# Create three objects from the MyClass class:

p1 = MyClass()
p2 = MyClass()
p3 = MyClass()

print(p1.x)
print(p2.x)
print(p3.x)
