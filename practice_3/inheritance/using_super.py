# Python also has a super() function that will make the child class inherit all the methods 
# and properties from its parent:

# Example
class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)
# By using the super() function, you do not have to use the name of the parent element, 
# it will automatically inherit the methods and properties from its parent.
